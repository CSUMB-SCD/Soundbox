### Chat Application

* Names of your team members, including how you distributed the work between your team members.  
  Write about your strategy for handling the “interfaces” between each other’s code. 
  
Cindy and Diego were in charge of the chat application. Both setup the html and setup the sockets in order
to be able to send and receive messages. Cindy then added the username and list of users. Diego added the 
number of people connected and background image. Both finally worked on the css to make the webpage look nice.

* What are known problems, if any, with your project?

A known problem is that even though the chat log is scrollable, it does not display the last message sent without 
having to scroll to see it.

* How would you improve it if you had more time?

We would fix the previous problem explained. As well as, make the webpage look more modern.
