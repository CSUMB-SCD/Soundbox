# Soundbox

SoundsBox is a web application that helps the user identify music with a short music sample utilizing the device's microphone. <br/>
The user will provide SoundBox with a small 5 second sample of music of their choice. <br/>
SoundBox will then display the songs' artist, title and a list of recommended artist. <br/>

The lessons learned from this project is to always deploy as soon as possible. <br/> 
Our project would always work with C9 but as soon as we would deploy on C9, nothing would work. <br/>
Since we are using Heroku under a free plan, there are a lot of limitations. <br/>
For example, we had to cut down the time the user can upload the music sample. <br/>
Heroku limits the megabytes allowed to upload, but it does not throw an error. <br/>
Communication is always a great feature to have in a team. <br/>
The more you communicate, the smoother the project will come together. <br/>
We stumled through a lot of obstacles, but thanks to our communication we were able to overcome them. <br/>
